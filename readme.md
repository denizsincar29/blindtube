# YouTube Player for the Blind

This is a YouTube player written in Python that is designed to be accessible for visually impaired users. The application allows users to enter a search query, select a video from the search results, and play it. Please note that the hotkeys feature is planned for future development.

## Installation

To install and run the YouTube player, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
      git clone https://github.com/denizsincar29/blindtube
   

2. Change directory to the cloned repository:
      cd blindtube
   

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:
      pip install -r requirements.txt
   

## Running the Application

To start the YouTube player, run the following command:
python main.py


Please note that at the current time, the application may not work with Python 3.12 due to a compatibility issue with the accessible_output2 library. This library relies on the platform_utils library, which may not yet be compatible with Python 3.12. However, it should work with other versions of Python.
